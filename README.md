# BuJo with Obsidian Notes
#### Bullet Journal Templates for Obsidian writing application

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.me) "is the private and flexible writing app that adapts to the way you think"

BuJo, or [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) as it's called, "is a mindfulness practice designed as a productivity system". 

Everyone has their own way of tracking tasks and managing information, but I think everyone can also use a bit of help from time to time. I've been a long term user of the BuJo system of notetaking and a short time user of Obsidian. In my short time with Obsidian I've found the paring of it and the BuJo methed to be outsdanding. I reached this point by reading what others have done and experimintation, and now that I have the system working for me I think some of this could be a good starting point for others.

I welcome questions, feedback, and additions.

## The basics of BuJo templating

BuJo can be as complicated or as simple as you would like, I aim for the simpler side of a writer and engineer. Someone seeking the colorful and more artistic of BuJo likely won't find Obsidian to be the right place for their work.
